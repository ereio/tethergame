Project Description: The game is meant to be a puzzle/thriller game. However, in its current state, you can't do much.
I sincerely apologize for the state this is in. I have been working hard on this but I just didn't time manage well enough and
the scale of this project was too great for me not too.
Most of the time was dedicated to creating an inventory system so my player could hold a weapon or a flashlight and fight back.
The flashlight is meant to harm the enemy. The enemy is supposed to move along a nav mesh but I simply could not figure out
what I was doing wrong and thus it doesn't move. Everything is in place for it to work but I'm too tired to figure it out.
I'm sevearly deprived of sleep and I can barely type.

Controls: Tab - Open/close inventory
